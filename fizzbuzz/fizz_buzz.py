"""
A 5 yr old has been asked by their teacher to write the fizzbuzz program.
He/She understands that he/she needs your help.
You being the expert advisor and very dear friend took pity on him/her,
and at the same time want to be convincing. Therefore, you decide to
abandon the modulo (%) and quotient (/) operator. You decide to help your
friend using good old finger counting method.

Given an integer(N), write the fizzbuzz program that prints 1 to N
with following restrictions.
a) Prints "Fizz" if number is divisible by 3
b) Print "Buzz" if number is divisible by 5
c) Print "Fizzbuzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 i.e, 15
d) Number is neither divisible by 3 nor 5
